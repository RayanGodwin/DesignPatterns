// This entire sample has been picked up from the blog of Dejan Agostini and can be extended to represent the organisational structure of a company.
// Composite pattern is used to represent tree like structure to represent complex hierarchies between objects. Composite hides the complex hierarchy of object structure from client, so that client can handle all the objects uniformly as defined by the abstraction. Example is file structure used on desktops. This is a pattern to build recursive dataType.
